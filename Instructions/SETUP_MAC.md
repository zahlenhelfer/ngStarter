### (1) Basics

Install fresh OS-X (from USB stick)

Get all software updates

Remove unwanted stuff from the dock (iPhoto)


### (2) Additional software from the AppStore 
	
Xcode (includes command line tools like git and all the compilers)

Dash (great offline reference to all libraries / languages)

Text Wrangler (free text editor)

Visual Diff (great diff tool)

Acorn (picture editing)

xDiagram (Visio for grown-ups)


**Important:** Start XCode at least once to confirm the license and load the extensions

### (3) System settings

Enable software installation from insecure sources in System settings / security

### (4) Git Client

Either
	Sourcetree [http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download]() or GitHub-Client: [https://central.github.com/mac/latest]()

### (5) Brower

Install Chrome from [http://chrome.google.com]()

Load the Batarang extension from the chrome web store ([https://www.google.com/intl/de/chrome/webstore/]()): [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk
]()	

Enable Developer menu in Safari in Settings / extended

### (6) Terminal

	cd 
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.14.0/install.sh | bash

open new terminal window 

	nvm install v0.10.29 # DO NOT USE 0.10.31, nom 2 will break a lot of stuff
	nvm alias default 0.10.29

### (8) Install Yeoman and angular generator

	npm cache clear
	npm install -g yo
	npm update -g yo     # no longer necessary if you got yo 1.2.1

Don't panic if grunt installation fails

### (12) Create a simple app and start it

	cd
	mkdir tmp && cd tmp
	mkdir testapp && cd testapp
	yo angular test
	npm install grunt --save-dev # right now the included grunt looks broken
	grunt serve

### (13) Build a production version

	grunt build
	cd dist
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4104

goto [http://localhost:4104]() in your favorite browser
