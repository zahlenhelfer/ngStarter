# Welcome to dcsfuerth/ngStarter

## What's going on here

This repo is based on [http://joshdmiller.github.io/ng-boilerplate/#/home]()
which sadly hasn't be updated for a long time and is barely useable at the moment.

In addition this contains additional information on how to start an angular project including suggested machine setup for mac ([https://github.com/dcsfuerth/ngStarter/blob/master/Instructions/SETUP_MAC.md]()) and ubuntu.

## Getting started

How to get started with the template ([https://github.com/dcsfuerth/ngStarter/tree/master/Template]()):

	cd ./template
	npm install
	bower install
	grunt watch --force
	cd build
