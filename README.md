# Welcome to dcsfuerth/ngStarter

## What's going on here

This repo is based on [http://joshdmiller.github.io/ng-boilerplate/#/home]()
which sadly hasn't be updated for a long time and is barely usable at the moment.

In addition this contains information on how to start an angular project including our [suggested machine setup ](Instructions/README.md)

## Getting started

How to get started with the template ([https://github.com/dcsfuerth/ngStarter/blob/master/Template]()):

	cd ./template
	npm install
	bower install
	grunt watch --force
	cd build
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4104

open in browser [http://localhost:4104]()
